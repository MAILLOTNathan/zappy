Here you can do many things to customize the experience.

WORLD :
    Here you can change the *frequency* of the Amber world.

CAMERA :
    But you can also customize how you see the world !

    If you are a FPS harcore player, don't worry about the DPI of your mouse.
    You can configure it here !

    And if you are here just to enjoy life, you can enable the cinematic mode !
    (WIP)

DISCONNECT :
    The simulation is not funny enough ? Don't panic, you can choose another
    one be disconnecting to the current session.

QUIT :
    But maybe Amber is boring for you...
    It hurts but we hope to see you later... Bye !

You don't think it's silent ? Let's play some music !
